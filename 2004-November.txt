Summary: KeyboardInterrupt Not Handled

Details: This should be pretty easy, just i need to retab just about every line so it's not a job to do at the present time.  Yet it is still a bug because the bot closes down heavily.

10:28 <@IRCBP> I am in: #IRCBP
10:28 <@Nigel> !join #nigel
10:28 <@Nigel> !part #ircbp

Basicly the problem you can see is that you can !join a channel the bot is already in and !part a channel that the bot is already in.

Subject: [ircbp-devel] [Bug #2781] Bot doesn't phase RAW messages
Message-ID: <200411132143.iADLhdon028850@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #2781, was updated on 2004-Nov-14 10:43
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: The IRC Bot Project
Category: Framework
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 8
Submitted by: nigelj
Assigned to : nigelj
Summary: Bot doesn't phase RAW messages

Details: By phasing RAW numerics we would be able to work out if we can actually join a channel and what our situation of the channel is.  An example is:  if the bot has only 1 channel defined and it tries to join it but is banned (or channel is invite only) it will fail, but the bot will be stuck in the console and on the server.  This means you have to Ctrl+C (or kill) that process.

Phasing of the raw numerics would help.
