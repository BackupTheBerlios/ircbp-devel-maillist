Comment:
Something I overlooked during release, I will do a 0.1.1 release tomorrow because of this (most likely).

For now just set REALNAME to something other than null

Summary: !part Parts the wrong channel

Details: Somewhere in Pankey's code there is something that causes the bot to part the wrong channel.  Obviously this needs to be fixed, and shall be during my Channel Handling overhaul.
